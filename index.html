      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I have worked in the information technology field all of my carreer.
        In that time I have held a lot of differing positions, however,
        my passion has always been using development ot bring people ideas to life.
        I've been lucky to travel aroud the world and live in lots of
        different countries. I am currently living and working in Australia,
        however my heart belongs to Scotland!
      </p>
      <p>I’ve been a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>

      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>Cycling, Cycling, Cycling - I was very lucky in my younger years to get into cycling both racing and for fun.
        What started out as a hobbie has led to a passion bordering on 'lunancy'. I have met lifelong friends,
        travelled to
        and witnessed some of the worlds greatest cycling events and seen some of natures greatest achivements whilst
        on a bike!
